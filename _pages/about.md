I’m a data scientist with a passion for leveraging AI and advanced analytics to drive smarter business decisions. My journey into data began in an unexpected place, mechanical engineering. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a solid foundation in vector calculus, multivariate analysis, and control theory, all of which laid the groundwork for my analytical mindset. Outside the classroom, I led the powertrain division of an intercollegiate [off-road racing team](https://www.instagram.com/bajanitkracing/) and honed my coding skills through robotics competitions.

My professional career started in manufacturing, where I served as a project management engineer at a [global valve manufacturer](https://www.lntvalves.com/). There, I introduced data-driven solutions; building Power BI dashboards and automating workflows that improved operational efficiency by over 25% and saved hundreds of work hours monthly.

Later, as a data analyst at [Hexagon AB](https://hexagon.com/), I worked extensively with SQL, Python, and cloud platforms like Azure and Redshift. I optimized large-scale databases, implemented data quality checks, and developed automated preprocessing pipelines for datasets exceeding 10 million records. My work directly enhanced reporting efficiency, data reliability, and reduced system costs.

Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Data Science and Analytics at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/), where I’m deepening my expertise in AI model development and evaluation.

With a blend of engineering rigor and data science creativity, I’m driven to solve complex problems and create value at scale.
